# 100Days-SwiftUI
All checkpoints and projects I made as part of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Hacking with Swift.

Checkpoint 1

A Swift Playground that:

Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.
