# 100Days-SwiftUI
All checkpoints and projects I made as part of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Hacking with Swift.

## Checkpoint 1

A Swift Playground that:

1. Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
2. Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
3. Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

## Checkpoint 2

1. You should start by creating an array of strings, using something like let albums = ["Red", "Fearless"]
2. You can read the number of items in your array using albums.count.
count also exists for sets.
3. Sets can be made from arrays using Set(someArray)
4. Sets never include duplicates.

## Checkpoint 3

The problem is called fizz buzz, and has been used in job interviews, university entrance tests, and more for as long as I can remember. Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

If it's a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
If it's a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
If it's a multiple of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise, just print the number.
So, here are some example values you should have when your code runs:

1 should print "1"
2 should print "2"
3 should print "Fizz"
4 should print "4"
5 should print "Buzz"
6 should print "Fizz"
7 should print "7"
…
15 should print "FizzBuzz"
…
100 should print "Buzz"
