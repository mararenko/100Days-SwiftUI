# 100Days-SwiftUI
All checkpoints and projects I made as part of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Hacking with Swift.

## Checkpoint 1

A Swift Playground that:

1. Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
2. Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
3. Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

## Checkpoint 2

1. You should start by creating an array of strings, using something like let albums = ["Red", "Fearless"]
2. You can read the number of items in your array using albums.count.
count also exists for sets.
3. Sets can be made from arrays using Set(someArray)
4. Sets never include duplicates.

## Checkpoint 3

The problem is called fizz buzz, and has been used in job interviews, university entrance tests, and more for as long as I can remember. Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

1. If it's a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
2. If it's a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
3. If it's a multiple of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
4. Otherwise, just print the number.

So, here are some example values you should have when your code runs:

```swift
1 should print "1"
2 should print "2"
3 should print "Fizz"
4 should print "4"
5 should print "Buzz"
6 should print "Fizz"
7 should print "7"
…
15 should print "FizzBuzz"
…
100 should print "Buzz"
```

## Checkpoint 4

The challenge is this: write a function that accepts an integer from 1 through 10,000 and returns the integer square root of that number. That sounds easy, but there are some catches:

1. You can't use Swift's built-in sqrt() function or similar – you need to find the square root yourself.
2. If the number is less than 1 or greater than 10,000 you should throw an "out of bounds" error.
3. You should only consider integer square roots – don't worry about the square root of 3 being 1.732, for example.
4. If you can't find the square root, throw a "no root" error.

This is a problem you should "brute force" – create a loop with multiplications inside, looking for the integer you were passed in.

## Checkpoint 5

With closures under your belt, it's time to try a little coding challenge using them.

You've already met `sorted()`, `filter()`, `map()`, so I'd like you to put them together in a chain – call one, then the other, then the other back to back without using temporary variables.

Your input is this:

```swift
let luckyNumbers = [7, 4, 38, 21, 16, 15, 12, 33, 31, 49]
```

Your job is to:

1. Filter out any numbers that are even
2. Sort the array in ascending order
3. Map them to strings in the format "7 is a lucky number"
4. Print the resulting array, one item per line

So, your output should be as follows:

```swift
7 is a lucky number
15 is a lucky number
21 is a lucky number
31 is a lucky number
33 is a lucky number
49 is a lucky number
```

## Checkpoint 6

create a struct to store information about a car, including its model, number of seats, and current gear, then add a method to change gears up or down. Have a think about variables and access control: what data should be a variable rather than a constant, and what data should be exposed publicly? Should the gear-changing method validate its input somehow?

## Checkpoint 7

Your challenge is this: make a class hierarchy for animals, starting with `Animal` at the top, then `Dog` and `Cat` as subclasses, then `Corgi` and `Poodle` as subclasses of `Dog`, and `Persian` and `Lion` as subclasses of `Cat`.

But there's more:

1. The `Animal` class should have a `legs` integer property that tracks how many legs the animal has.
2. The `Dog` class should have a `speak()` method that prints a generic dog barking string, but each of the subclasses should print something slightly different.
3. The `Cat` class should have a matching `speak()` method, again with each subclass printing something different.
4. The `Cat` class should have an `isTame` Boolean property, provided using an initializer.

## Checkpoint 8

Your challenge is this: make a protocol that describes a building, adding various properties and methods, then create two structs, `House` and `Office`, that conform to it. Your protocol should require the following:

1. A property storing how many rooms it has.
2. A property storing the cost as an integer (e.g. 500,000 for a building costing $500,000.)
3. A property storing the name of the estate agent responsible for selling the building.
4. A method for printing the sales summary of the building, describing what it is along with its other properties.

## Checkpoint 9

Your challenge is this: write a function that accepts an optional array of integers, and returns one randomly. If the array is missing or empty, return a random number in the range 1 through 100.

If that sounds easy, it's because I haven't explained the catch yet: I want you to write your function in a single line of code. No, that doesn't mean you should just write lots of code then remove all the line breaks – you should be able to write this whole thing in one line of code.
